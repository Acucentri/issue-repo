Shuffle Cards:
>Variables
    vector<Card> cardDeck[52] = {Initialize all cards in order};
>Algorithm by Fisher-Yates
 1. Set the seed for the random number generator
 3. Select last unselected card
 3. Choose random number n between 0 and the last target index
 4. Flip the last unselected card with with the card at index n
 5. If all card have not been targeted go to line 3
 6. If all cards have been flipped once return the card deck

Real-Time Game:
>Algorithm - Builder
 1. Choose next card from shuffled deck
 2. Place card at next available locatation on tableau in respect to the pattern
  .i   1..7 card(s) placed on spot 1..7
  .ii  the top card in each section beguins the section's "face up" list
 3. Place the remaining cards from the shuffled deck to the stock
 4. Profit
>Algorithm - Solver
 1. Select top card of tableau face up section 1..7
 2. Compare with targetted bottom card of tableau face up section in each section other than target
  .i   If the selected card can fit under target
    .i   Move top of selected to bottom of target
    .ii  Set next card in selected tableau section to that sections face up
  .ii  If the selected card is a King and the target is empty then move selected card to target location
  .iii If the selected card has no moves on the tableau check aces section 1..7
    .i   If selected card is the same suit and comes after the card in the targetted aces section
      .i   More selectedf card to target location
 3. Draw card from stock and put into talon then check if it can go anywhere just like step 1 to 3
 4. Go back to 1 until there are no more moves or you win





OLD STUFF - DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
 1. Remove card from the Stock and add to Talon stack
 2. While (count<=3 or there are still moves
 3.    While there are still moves in Tableau
 4.       For(Cards Focus: Tableau)
 5.          For(Cards Target: Tableau)
 6.             if Focus.top.high.value equals (Taget.top.low.value)-1 and Focus.top.high.color!=Taget.top.low.color then,
 7.                Move Focus.top to Target.top
 8.                if Focus.bottom!=null then, Move Focus.bottom.high to Focus.top
 9.             else there are no moves
10.    If Stock.size equals 0 and count<=3 then,
11.       count++
12.       Move Talon.end->start to Stock.start->end
13.    If Talon is empty and Stock is not then, move Stock.top to Talon.top 
14.       If Talon.top.value equals 0 (Ace) then, move Talon.top to Foundation
15.       For(Cards Target: Tableau)  
16.          If (Talon.top.value equals (Taget.top.low.value)-1 and Talon.top.low.color!=Target.color) or (target.top=NULL and Talon.top.value equals 12) then,
17.             Move Talon.top to Target.top and break
18.          else there are no moves
29. If there are no moves and Talon isnt empty and count>3 then, game over you lost
20. For(Cards Focus: Tableau)
21.    For(Cards Target: Foundation)
22.    If (Focus.top.low.value)-1 equals Target.high then,
23.       Move Focus.top.low to target.highand break
24. If Foundation[0..3].top.value equals 12 then, you have won
