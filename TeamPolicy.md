**GROUP REPOS** → Create an organization for our group.

**INDIVIDUAL REPOS** → Each student will create an individual repository under their profile

**ISSUES REPOS→** Create an issues repository inside group organization.

**Team Policies** :

1. Team members should abide by [CSBSJU behavioral policies](https://www.csbsju.edu/csb-student-development/student-life-policies) and conduct themselves in a professional manner. Team members should work to support each other and provide constructive feedback.
2. All work will be tracked in the Acucentri Organization issues-only repository &#39; **issues-repo&#39;**.
3. Team members are expected to abide by the following when using GitHub:
   - When committing code, provide meaningful commit messages to maintain organization throughout the repository.
   - Commit messages should contain action words
     - [Writing Good Comments](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages)
   - Always pull first before making any changes to code/project so it does not create any conflict with other group member&#39;s work
   - Update readme file or group member when using or adding any new tools for project. Can be for testing, design or program.
   - Each member is expected to use Git branching when starting a new sprint, bug-fixing, adding new features, etc. so that a working copy of our project is not disrupted.
   - Continuous integration (Travis CI, GitHub Actions, etc.) should be implemented so that tests and other automated tasks can run each time code is committed/pushed.
4. Each team member will have an individual Acucentri repository:
   - Lastname-Firstname-CS317
5. Team members will add their work to the Acucentri organization if it is work for the group project. Otherwise, individual work outside of the group project is kept in the team member&#39;s individual repository.
6. Team members will provide fully documented code in order to organize the system and make the logic used clear to other members of the group.
7. Communication should be over our Slack network, [slack.com](http://acucentri.slack.com).
8. Team development will be tracked using a kanban board, where tasks will be divided amongst members of the group and will be categorized as &#39;To Do&#39;, &#39;In Progress&#39;, &#39;Testing&#39; or &#39;Completed&#39;.
9. To maintain order and organization, team members should perform periodic cleanups to the group preposity and remove any work that is no longer needed for project development.
10. Any concerns not addressed by team policies should be discussed with the rest of the team.
